# Wojciech Stark
I'm a PhD student in Computational Chemistry at the University of Warwick ([Computational Surface Science Group](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/research/maurer/maurergroup/)). I obtained my BSc and MSc in Chemistry from the Warsaw Univeristy of Technology.


## Research
I'm currently working on developing ML-based models that enable simulating adiabatic and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics of hydrogen molecules at different copper surfaces.
