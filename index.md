# Wojciech Stark

I'm a Research Associate at Imperial College London ([AIchemy hub](https://aichemy.ac.uk)). I obtained PhD at the University of Warwick ([Computational Surface Science Group (Maurer group)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/research/maurer/maurergroup/)) with the thesis titled "Machine Learning Models for Gas-Surface Dynamics". Before that, I studied at the Warsaw University of Technology (BSc and MSc).

## Research
I'm developing ML-based models for gas-surface dynamics, for both adiabatic (Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics) and non-adiabatic (molecular dynamics with electronic friction) approaches.
