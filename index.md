# Wojciech Stark

I'm a Research Associate at Imperial College London ([AIchemy hub](https://aichemy.ac.uk)). I obtained my PhD at the University of Warwick ([Computational Surface Science Group (Maurer group)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/research/maurer/maurergroup/)) with the thesis titled "Machine Learning Models for Gas-Surface Dynamics". Before that, I completed my BSc and MSc at the Warsaw University of Technology.

## Research

### Bayesian Optimization and Property Models
I'm currently working on discovering new catalysts and optimizing reaction conditions using Bayesian optimization.

### Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials
Another part of my research involves developing workflows and methods for training highly accurate and efficient machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) at the lowest possible computational cost.

### Nonadiabatic Effects in Gas-Surface Dynamics
During my PhD, I developed machine learning models to capture nonadiabatic effects in gas-surface dynamics, particularly for studying hydrogen molecule state-to-state scattering at metal surfaces.
