# Wojciech Stark

I'm a Research Assistant at the University of Warwick ([Computational Surface Science Group (Maurer group)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/research/maurer/maurergroup/)). I recently defended my PhD thesis titled "Machine Learning Models for Gas-Surface Dynamics" (in the same group). I obtained my BSc and MSc in Chemistry from the Warsaw University of Technology.


## Research
I'm developing ML-based models for gas-surface dynamics, for both adiabatic (Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics) and non-adiabatic (molecular dynamics with electronic friction) approaches.
